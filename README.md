Basic file to learn Github
This is a basic edit so I can deepen my understanding of Github. I understand that a branch is a copy of the master branch. Once I finish making changes on that branch I then commit my changes and create a pull request (whatever that means). Then the person in charge of the master branch can decide to merge my changes to the master or reject it.
